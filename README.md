# Cancas, a simple graphics library

Cancas is a simple [stb-style](https://github.com/nothings/stb "stb repo") header-only library designed to be a simple way to make an image.

## WIP

This project just started. No documentation provided as of right now.

Inspired by [olive.c](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c "olive.c repo").
